# Savvy Funnel Analytics Dashboard

A Next.js 14 dashboard application that replaces Tableau for funnel analytics, providing real-time insights into lead conversion rates, pipeline performance, and team metrics.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This dashboard connects directly to BigQuery to visualize data from the `vw_funnel_master` view, which serves as the single source of truth for all funnel analytics. The application provides:

- **Real-time Funnel Metrics**: SQLs, SQOs, Joined advisors, and pipeline AUM
- **Conversion Rate Analysis**: Track conversion rates across all funnel stages (Contacted→MQL→SQL→SQO→Joined)
- **Trend Visualization**: Monthly and quarterly trend charts for conversion rates and volumes
- **Channel & Source Performance**: Drill down into performance by marketing channel and lead source
- **Team Performance**: Filter and analyze performance by SGA (Sales Growth Advisor) and SGM (Sales Growth Manager)
- **User Management**: Role-based access control with admin, manager, SGM, SGA, and viewer roles

## 📊 Data Source

The dashboard queries the `vw_funnel_master` BigQuery view (`savvy-gtm-analytics.Tableau_Views.vw_funnel_master`), which:

- **Joins Leads and Opportunities**: Combines Salesforce Lead and Opportunity data with proper deduplication
- **Handles Attribution**: Tracks SGA/SGM ownership at both lead and opportunity levels
- **Calculates Conversion Flags**: Pre-computes progression flags (contacted_to_mql_progression, mql_to_sql_progression, etc.)
- **Manages Eligibility**: Tracks which records are eligible for conversion rate calculations
- **Deduplicates Opportunities**: Ensures opportunity-level metrics (SQO, Joined, AUM) count once per opportunity

### Key Fields from `vw_funnel_master`:

- **Date Fields**: `FilterDate`, `stage_entered_contacting__c`, `converted_date_raw`, `Date_Became_SQO__c`, `advisor_join_date__c`
- **Conversion Flags**: `is_contacted`, `is_mql`, `is_sql`, `is_sqo`, `is_joined`
- **Progression Flags**: `contacted_to_mql_progression`, `mql_to_sql_progression`, `sql_to_sqo_progression`, `sqo_to_joined_progression`
- **Eligibility Flags**: `eligible_for_contacted_conversions`, `eligible_for_mql_conversions`, `eligible_for_sql_conversions`, `eligible_for_sqo_conversions`
- **Deduplication**: `is_sqo_unique`, `is_joined_unique`, `is_primary_opp_record`
- **Attribution**: `SGA_Owner_Name__c`, `SGM_Owner_Name__c`, `Original_source`, `Channel_Grouping_Name`

## ✅ Current Status

### Completed Phases

- ✅ **Phase 1**: Project setup and infrastructure
- ✅ **Phase 2**: BigQuery connection layer with parameterized queries
- ✅ **Phase 3**: Authentication and permissions system
- ✅ **Phase 4**: All API routes (funnel-metrics, conversion-rates, source-performance, detail-records, forecast, open-pipeline, filters)
- ✅ **Phase 5**: All dashboard components (Scorecards, ConversionRateCards, ConversionTrendChart, tables, filters)
- ✅ **Phase 6**: Main dashboard page with data fetching and state management

### Known Issues

⚠️ **Conversion Trends Chart Bug**: The trend chart is displaying incorrect conversion rates and volumes that don't align with scorecard values. See [`conversion-rates-chart-bug.md`](./conversion-rates-chart-bug.md) for detailed documentation.

**Example Discrepancy (Q4 2025)**:
- Scorecard (correct): Contacted→MQL: 3.6%, SQL→SQO: 74.6%, SQO→Joined: 11.6%
- Chart (incorrect): Contacted→MQL: 8.6%, SQL→SQO: 59.1%, SQO→Joined: 4.1%
- Volumes: Chart shows 114 SQOs vs 144 actual, 6 Joined vs 17 actual

**Root Cause**: The `getConversionTrends()` function uses different date field groupings for numerators and denominators, causing period mismatches. Cohort restrictions also exclude valid conversions that span multiple periods.

## 🎯 Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Replace Tableau Dependencies**: Provide a self-hosted, customizable alternative to Tableau dashboards
2. **Real-time Data Access**: Direct BigQuery integration for up-to-date metrics without manual refreshes
3. **Role-based Access**: Secure access control with different permission levels (admin, manager, SGM, SGA, viewer)
4. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor conversion rates across all funnel stages with trend analysis
5. **Team Analytics**: Enable SGA and SGM filtering to track individual and team performance

### Conversion Rate Tracking

The dashboard tracks four key conversion rates, each tied to specific date dimensions:

1. **Contacted → MQL**: Based on `stage_entered_contacting__c`
   - Numerator: Leads that became MQL (`is_mql = 1`)
   - Denominator: All leads that were contacted

2. **MQL → SQL**: Based on `converted_date_raw` (numerator) and `stage_entered_contacting__c` (denominator)
   - Numerator: SQLs that converted (`is_sql = 1`)
   - Denominator: MQLs that became MQLs in the period

3. **SQL → SQO**: Based on `Date_Became_SQO__c` (numerator) and `converted_date_raw` (denominator)
   - Numerator: SQOs that became SQO (`is_sqo_unique = 1`, recruiting record type)
   - Denominator: SQLs that converted in the period

4. **SQO → Joined**: Based on `advisor_join_date__c` (numerator) and `Date_Became_SQO__c` (denominator)
   - Numerator: Advisors that joined (`is_joined_unique = 1`)
   - Denominator: SQOs that became SQO in the period

### Key Metrics

- **Volume Metrics**: SQLs, SQOs, Joined advisors
- **Pipeline Metrics**: Open Pipeline AUM, Joined AUM
- **Conversion Rates**: All four stage-to-stage conversion rates
- **Channel Performance**: Performance breakdown by marketing channel
- **Source Performance**: Performance breakdown by lead source
